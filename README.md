## Description 📝

Trap Talk is a secret messaging application that is protected by 2-step authentication. It is a app where you can message other users that you have added as a friend and know that your messages are protected, EVEN if your login credentials get into the wrong hands. 

Your 4-digit pin is the key to revealing your real messages. If the user was to login with just username and password, a decoy landing page will be revealed with wholesome generic message. Only the real owner of the account will know where the easter egg on the page is to reveal the 4-digit pin modal to enter their pin and access the real messages.

This application has the ability to send and receive messages and add and remove friends. It is designed to be accessible through desktop or mobile phone.
